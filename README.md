# Lord of the Rings - The Purist Edition

This project aims to create a free, legal, creative commons based purist edit of the Lord of the Rings that will be made available to the public. The goal is to project everything except the video itself to the end user (since distributing the video would break copyright laws). The end user will be able to import their "licensed" copies of the three films into the project, git the export button, and render their own copies of The Purist Edition.

Gentoo Linux will be used. The video editor to be used is currently being investigated. For now, it looks like the three most viable options are:
1. Blender
2. OpenShot
3. KDEnlive
